# Reddit Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing Reddit data to answer questions related to "BMW", that leverages social media for market research. The analysis spans the entire data science process, from data collection to communicating findings.

## Learning Outcomes

This assignment including applying data science to analyze social media and networks, employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment and topic detection, and presenting insights from social media and network analysis.


### Scenario
Working for BMW, tasked with conducting market research using social media analytics, the project aims to demonstrate the capabilities to a potential client unfamiliar with such analytics.

## Assignment Details

### Questions to Answer
To address the client's goals, the project seeks to answer questions such as:
- What are the trending concepts and topics associated with a selected entity?
- What are the perceptions and feelings towards the selected entity?

### Data Collection
Data is collected from Reddit, ensuring a meaningful dataset for analysis.

### Data Pre-processing and Exploration
Initial exploration involves computing basic statistics on the data, checking the number of submissions, and exploring unique words. Pre-processing includes evaluating language consistency and removing irrelevant characters.

### Method/Model
Selected models and approaches are run, with attention to parameter settings' impact on results. The analysis may lead to additional data pre-processing.

### Analysis
Results are presented to answer the project's questions, discussing topics, their relevance to recent news, or other information sources. Inconsistencies are explored, and reasoning behind the findings is provided.

### Communication
The assignment concludes with a report detailing answers, findings, and insights. Visualizations, including tables, plots, and word clouds, aid in presenting results to the hypothetical client and the lecturer.

## Technologies Used

The project is implemented using Python, with key libraries including pandas, numpy, surprise, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are applied for sentiment analysis and topic detection.
